# Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋

## 📝 About me
I am a Natural Sciences graduate from the University of Cambridge, hoping to start a successful career in technology. During my degree, I had the chance to work with a few different technologies, including Python, R and Mathematica. This inspired me to enrol on a Software Engineering Skills Bootcamp with [HyperionDev](https://www.hyperiondev.com/), where I have been learning the foundations of Python and some important concepts in computer science. I can't wait to continue improving my skills and growing my digital portfolio on GitHub!
